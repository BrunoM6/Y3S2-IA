    "The `problem_description` array holds, in order, from 0 to 4, the number of videos, number of endpoints, number of request descriptions, number of cache servers, and the capacity of each cache server in megabytes.\n",
    "The `video_size` array holds the size of each video in MB.\n",
    "We then parse based on the ammount of endpoints, to connect each endpoint to the caches. The `endpoint_data_description` describes the latency between an endpoint (serves as the index of the array) and the data center (latency is the value stored), and the `endpoint_cache_description` has the key/value specification of key:(endpoint, cache) -> value:latency."
